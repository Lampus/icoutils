.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extresso
.RI [ OPTIONS "]... [" FILE ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBextresso\fP command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
Extresso reads resource scripts, and uses wrestool to extract the
listed resources and icotool to convert them (if necessary).
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

Where to place extracted files (default `.').
.TP
.BR \-\-format=FORMAT
Extraction format of icon resources, passed to icotool.
.TP
.BR \-b, \-\-base=DIR
Base directory of local files in scripts. (This will be appended
to ``file'' lines in the scripts.)
.TP

Prompt before extraction.
.TP
.BR \-v, \-\-verbose
Explain what is being done.
.TP

Output version information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Extract all resources from shell32.dll using the resource script
``win98_shell32'', assuming it is available in
``/windows/windows/system/shell32.dll'', and placing output in ``out/'':

  $ extresso ../data/resscripts/win98_shell32 --base=/windows/windows --output=out/
  $ find out/ -type f | wc -l
